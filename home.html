        <p>Neighbour of Laos, Cambodia and China, Vietnam is a South-East Asia country that is surrounded by the Gulf of Tonkin, South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. It is a splendid country whose geographic silhouette
          draws the shape of a dragon, symbol of strength and benefits the Far East. Having the shape of an "S", its long and narrow land covers 1,650 km.</p>
        <p>Geographically, the country is divided into three main regions filled with history and culture: Northern Vietnam, Central Vietnam and Southern Vietnam. Based on that division, several subregions are created. While most subregions are built
          as a shelter for the population nowadays, there are three distinct subregions for agricultural activities, namely the fertile Red River Delta in the north, the highlands of Center and South and the Mekong
          Delta They are saturated with water and are ideal for growing rice.</p>
        <p>Themed itineraries around three major poles would be Hà Nội, the capital of Vietnam, Huế, the ancient imperial city and Ho Chi Minh City, the Vietnam's most populous and
          economical city.</p>

      <article class=" multii slide-up show-on-scroll">
        <p style="margin-top:0">Vietnamese cuisine is one of the most popular oriental delicacies in North America. Traditionally, Vietnamese people love large family gatherings and share meals together since cooking represent a family activity and
          without it many dishes
          would never have been born to showcase, especially in family restaurant businesses.</p>
        <p>In Vietnam, whether ons is sitting along a sidewalk or is comfortably seated at a table, you always eat with chopsticks. It is a very common Vietnamese habit to eat with chopsticks for every meal of the day. That said, Vietnamese meals are
          always filled with flavourful dishes. In other words, every dish always have many tastes, namely salty, bitter, sour, pungent (spicy), umami and sweet. Not all dishes have allof these types of taste, nonetheless one can taste many of them
          at the same time.</p>
        <p>Vietnamese cuisine has many qualities as it is fine and light, healthy and very varied. Like many other cuisines around the world, Vietnamese have their own ways to cook and to present their dishes in a delicious manner. Accordingly, there
          are more than 500 national dishes and this amount of variety is the result of regional differences. Even so all these dishes offer a combination of interesting flavors and intriguing textures. The Northern flavours
          accompanied by spices and
          herbs are salty. The flavours of the Central regions are more rich. Finally, the dishes from Southern Vietname tend to be sweeter.</p>
        <p>Growing up in a Vietnamese family, one would say that the term "a full course meal" does not really exist as Vietnamese eats whatever dish they want at any time they wish to eat. In other words, Vietnamese dishes are simply served as food,
          so one can eat an "appetizer" or a "dessert" on the morning For instance, eating <em>Chè Chuối</em> in the morning is normal.</p>
        <p><em>Chè Chuối</em> is a dessert that can be served cold or heated up, and is what we call "Vietnamese Banana Soup," which still and will always sounds strange to my ears since I don't see it that way. Personally, if I have to describe
          <em>Chè Chuối</em>, I would say that it is a sort of fruity cereal dessert but never as soup because soup to my understanding is a boiling hot main dish soup for lunch or dinner. Then again, I would eat soup for breakfast!
        </p>
        <p>All in all, Vietnamese dishes can be served at anytime.</p>
        <p>The northern cuisine is very similar to the Chinese cuisine with its stir-fried dishes. Northerners complain that they cannot taste southern food because it is too sweet. Yet it is old, refined and very
          simple. Vietnamese
          northern cuisine mainly focuses on soups, stews and grilled meats.</p>
        <p><em>Phở</em>, the famous Vietnamese traditional soup is the very essence of Vietnamese cuisine. Originally from the north, it is renown to be the national dish of Vietnam. This type of soup can be eaten at any time of the day, from
          breakfast to dinner and there are many ways to prepare it. There could be more or less broth, more or less toppings, with chicken, pork or shrimp, etc.</p>
        <p>Either way, <em>Phở</em> is a dish that can be eaten on a regular basis in Vietnam. But,
          we must not forget that there are also other specialized dishes of this region, for instance, <em>Chả cá</em> is a fried fish dish with turmeric, dill and chives or <em>Bún chả</em>, a grilled of pork belly dish served with rice vermicelli,
          aromatic herbs and pickled vegetables.</p>
        <p>Historically linked to the imperial court and, in contrast, to the very poor fishing population, the central region of Vietnam has a long tradition of vegetarian cuisine. Northen regions' dishes are served in small portions to share since
          all Vietnamese
          often eat together to savour several dishes and to spend several hours chatting loudly.</p>
        <p>The cuisine of the central regions is characterized by a significant use of spices in all recipes. The cooks of these regions like to prepare their dishes with seafood such as crabs, shrimps, lobsters, and to make them spicy! That said,
          they do not prepare much squid and various fish dishes and, despite not having many specialized dishes, the central regions are inspired by its neighours regions and recreate their dishes. Nonetheless, one of their most famous specialties
          is a spicy soup made with rice vermicelli and beef, called <em>Bún bò Huế</em>.</p>
        <p>In the South, some Vietnamese don't like northern cuisine because it is too salty. For instance, Southern Vietnamese often use coconut milk to cook, resulting in a sweeter taste for many dishes. With a tropical climate, the lands from the
          south is more fertile and provides a more diverse range of ingredients. Likewise, it is overflowing with peppers, aromatic herbs and spices such as star anise, cloves, basil seeds, etc. </p>
        <p>Derived from northern cuisine, Southern Vietnamese cooks prepare dishes with a different approach. For example, <em>Hủ tiếu</em> , that is the southern version of <em>Phở</em>. Apart from the variety of soups, there are also <em>Gỏi
            Cuốn</em>, the famous fresh spring rolls, <em>Nem Nướng</em>, the seasoned ground pork skewers served with lettuce leaves, and <em>Cơm Tấm Sườn Bì Chả</em>, a dish composed of broken rice served with grilled pork (or pork chops), shredded
          pork skin and egg custard. Not to mention, there are about 20 to 30 types of <em>Chè</em>, a dessert consisting of food thickening agents, for example, agar-agar, beans, corn kernels, etc. bathed in sweet coconut milk for the majority of
          this type of dessert.</p>

    <section id="s2">
      <article class=" multii slide-up show-on-scroll">
        <p style="margin-top:0">The verb "to eat" in Vietnamese literally means "to eat rice," or <em>ăn cơm</em>. Rice called <em>Cơm</em> is one of the staple foods of the country. It is often eaten steamed, but it can also be crushed to make
          patties, deep-fried or
          even powdered to make pancakes, cakes and pasta. As Vietnam is one of the biggest rice producers, it is normal that there is a large variety of rice.</p>
        <p>For example, ordinary white rice with round and white grains, fragrant rice, like Basmati or Jasmine rice, recognizable thanks to its long grains and glutinous rice, which has opaque grains used for the preparation of offerings like the
          traditional cake, <em>Bánh Chưng</em>. Round, long, crushed, flavored with glutinous gold, rice includes dozens of varieties. <em>Xôi</em>, composed mainly of glutinous rice, <em>Gạo Nếp</em>. can be served as an appetizer, as a meal or
          even
          for dessert! <em>Cháo</em> is a rice porridge, congee or just rice soup that can be served with meat or vegetables.</p>
        <p>It is impossible for Vietnamese to live without fish sauce, <em>Nước Mắm</em>, this clear and brownish sauce obtained by the fermentation of salted fish is used as an ingredient or as an accompaniment to all dishes. It replaces salt,
          offers a rich contribution to the dishes by enhancing the delicate flavours! There is a variety of sauces that can be mixed with using Vietnamese fish sauce.</p>
        <p>For example, if you add crushed pepper, lime juice, chopped garlic and a little sugar, it will transform into <em>Nước Chấm</em>. As it is a national condiment that is unanimous from North to South. fish sauce fundamentally separates
          Vietnamese and Chinese cuisines! Nevertheless, one should not forget the soy sauce, <em>Nước Tương</em>, predominant in all Asian countries. A fun fact about soy sauces is that its origin gives rise to lively debates between many Asian
          countries claiming rights over it!</p>
        <p>Light and fragrant, Vietnamese cuisine uses fewer sauces, and more herbs and natural vegetables. Aromatic herbs are, in fact, part of all the spices found in South-East Asia. Vietnamese use them abundantly such as ginger, lemongrass,
          mint, cilantro, parsley, basil, garlic, chili, lime and much more! There are so many that one can make a never-ending list of fine herbs and spices!</p>
        <p>The most popular and consumed meats are pork, <em>Heo</em>, chicken, <em>Gà</em>, and duck, <em>Vịt</em>. Beef, <em>Bò</em>, is more expensive and rarer. Regarding the preparation, the meats are served steamed, grilled, sautéed, fried or
          stewed.</p>
        <p>Counless coastlines, rivers and canals covering up to 3000 km of the country, fish and seafood are supplied all year round and in large quantities! The main source of protein is freshwater and seawater fishes, <em>Cá</em>, crabs,
          <em>Cua</em>, shrimps, <em>Tôm</em>, and a variety of mollusks such as clams, <em>Sò</em>, and oysters, <em>Hàu</em>. Occasionally, it is possible to taste exotic dishes that contains exotic meat from cobras, <em>Rắn Hổ Mang</em>, pythons,
          <em>Trăn</em>, turtles, <em>Rùa</em>, porcupines, <em>Nhím</em>, dogs, <em>Chó</em>, geckos, <em>Tắc Kè</em>, bats, <em>Dơi</em>, or even pangolins, <em>Ngâm Tê Tê</em>.
        </p>
        <p>Consequently, one must be careful when it comes to consuming exotic
          meats and one must especially not vouch for the consumption of endangered species!

        <p style="margin-top:0">In Vietnam, people only drink mineral or purified water because tap water is not safe for consumption. Meaning that they buy water bottles or containers, store them in their home and refill whenever they got no more.
          Thus, there are
          several
          brands of mineral and purified water in plastic bottles that Vietnamese often buy, for example, La Vie, Aquafina, Vital, i-on-Life and much more.</p>
        <img id="pic-width1" class="slide-up-slower show-on-scroll" style="margin-left:auto" src="images\lotus-tea.jpg">
        <p>Often free in restaurants or at a ridiculous price, tea is
          indisputably a national drink. It is a flagship product in Vietnam as it can be drunk without sugar or milk. Light and fragrant, it allows you to relax. Black tea and lotus tea are very popular across the country. Green tea or artichoke tea
          are
          delightful to drink! Aside from infusing tea leaves to drink, making tea with tea bags are also very popular, especially the Lipton brand.</p>
        <img id="pic-width1" class="slide-up-slower show-on-scroll" style="margin-left:auto" src="images\ca-phe-sua-da-orig.jpg">
        <p>Did you know that Vietnam is the second largest producer of coffee in the world after Brazil? Famous for its coffee, the Vietnamese mainly use it for export. Of course they also consume it, but less than the western countries who adore it.
          Unlike tea, they like to drink very strong coffee, namely black coffee with has no milk nor sugar. Yet, some like to mix it with a sufficient amount of sweetened condensed milk, rather than using sugar. In Vietnam, rather than drinking a
          demitasse of espresso, people like to drink filtered coffee and it is served in a cup or tall glass topped with a small filter filled with boiling water. Otherwise, like all other countries, the Vietnamese can also serve all kinds of
          coffee,
          for instance latte and cappuccino. Oddly enough, freshly brewed coffee is considered inferior to instant coffee, though the latter is quite unhealthy!</p>
        <p>Very popular and particularly inexpensive in Vietnam, beer is a legacy of colonialism. Vietnamese light blonde beers are pleasant and refreshing. The most popular brands in Vietnam are <em>Bia Hơi, Saigòn, Tiger and 333</em>. Among
          alcoholic beverages, rice wine, <em>Rượu</em>, made from fermented rice, is the most popular. It is very similar to Japanese sake. Adorned with all medicinal virtues, snake wine is a type of rice wine that macerates a whole snake.
          Vietnam also produces fruit juices, excellent coconut milk and sugary soft drinks,such as <em>Sá Xị</em>, which I would say is an exotic Coca Cola drink!</p>

        <p style="margin-top:0"> As it is the heart and soul to many of the Southeast Asian countries and Vietnam is certainly one of it, Vietnam has a long tradition when it comes to street food. Outlining the streets, particularly the ones near
          local markets, there are many rustic outdoor food joints and rickety food carts with plastic tables and stools.</p>
        <p>In every city, there are many vendors walking around with baskets full of drinks, pastries, fresh fruit, etc. They can also travel around town on a tricycle
          used as a mobile canteen where they can prepare and serve us small meals. Others carry their cargo using a hoist over the shoulder with a basket at each end. That said, it is important to note that street food does not present any health
          risks. By following a few basic rules, there will be no problem!</p>
        <p>It is as much a popular activity for tourist as for the local Vietnamese citizens. Not to mention that one can find the same dishes eating out on the streets as the dishes in restaurants. For example, one can get <em>Phở</em>, <em>Bánh
            Tráng Nướng</em>, <em>Chè</em>, <em>Bánh Mì</em>, <em>Ốc</em>, <em>Gỏi Khô Bò</em>, <em>Cà Phê Trứng</em>, <em>Bánh Xèo</em>, <em>Xôi Chiên</em> and <em>Xôi Chiên Phồng</em>. All of these can possibly be acquired for a cheaper price yet
          just as delicious as the ones made in the kitchen of a restaurant!</p>

        <p style="margin-top:0">Unlike Chinese cuisine, Vietnamese cuisine is reduced in fat. Vietnamese people prefer meals that are light and less oily. This type of cooking allows one to not consume red meat. Truth be told, Buddhism has a long
          history on the
          development of Vietnam as well as on its vegetarian cuisine.</p>
        <p>Vegetarian food is an indispensable part of Vietnamese culinary culture. Through their creativity, Vietnamese citizens were able to create a diversified vegetarian diet that can
          match the mouthwatering dishes filled with meats.</p>
        <p>Coming from a Buddhist lifestyle, several scientific studies have proven that the vegetarian diet is affirmatively good for our health and useful in the cure of certain particular diseases.</p>
        <img id="pic-width1" class="slide-up-slower show-on-scroll" style="margin-left:auto" src="images\vegetarian.jpg">
        <p>This is why vegetarianism is becoming more and
          more a trend for the people of Vietnam. The ingredients that are used to prepare vegetarian foods are mainly tofu, <em>Đậu Hũ</em>, vegetables, roots, fruits, soy products and mushrooms.</p>
        <p>Through an all plant-based diet, making vegetarian
          meals need to be delicious, healthy and also eye-catching. That said, there is a variety of vegetarian foods that can offer a person all the nutrients one needs for the day. Across the country there are several vegetarian restaurants and
          shops, where you can stock up on the necessary ingredients.</p>

        <p style="margin-top:0">Over time, Vietnam is a country that has undergone multiple changes due to the influences of colonialism, yet it managed to preserve its culinary identity. During the long period of Chinese reign, the use of
          chopsticks, soy sauce and tofu became part of Vietnamese cuisine and gastronomical lifestyle. A fun fact about <em>Phở</em> is that many beliefs that it originates from the North of Vietnam and Vietnam has rights over the creation of this
          delectable soup. As a matter of fact, it is true that <em>Phở</em> was created by Northern Vietnamese citizens but the dish was inspired from Chinese noodle soup when Vietnam was under the Chinese rule.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, France left some inspiring culinary memories, namely leaving behind their famous baguette for Vietnamese chefs to transform it into a scrumptious <em>Bánh mì</em>, a Vietnamese sandwich that was brought to life from the
          French Indochina colonial era. There is also ham, sausages, croissants, pâtés, dairy products such as <em>La Vache qui rit</em> cheese and so much more but, above all, coffee!</p> <br>
        <p>In turn, Americans gave Vietnam wonderful gifts, namely the globally well-known soft drink called Coca-Cola and ice cream. With that, more deliciousli inviting desserts were created, such as Vietnamese banana and coconut ice cream, <em>Kem
            Chuối</em>, durian-flavoured ice cream <em>Kem Sầu Riêng</em>, black beans ice cream <em>Kem Đậu Đen</em>, Vietnamese coconut ice cream, <em>Kem Dừa</em> and much more. This is how several dairies have established themselves in the
          country.</p>
        <p>Finally, thanks to Indian, Champa, Khmer and Thai influences, the use of curry and coconut has become part of southern cuisine to make Vietnamese mini pancake, <em>Bánh Khọt</em> and chicken curry with coconut milk <em>Cà ri</em>. Not very
          well-known, Vietnamese adopted dishes like Russian (potato) salad, <em>Sa lát Nga</em>, owing to the contact with previous communist countries from Eastern Europe.</p>
