        <br>
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong><em>Lam Ky Anh Do</em></strong>, but I go by <strong><em>Falé</em></strong>. It's easier to remember, and I am currently a Design student at Concordia University!</p>
        <p>Currently, I live in Montreal, one of the enthusiastic and festive cities of Canada. But more specifically in Nun's Island, a little island beside the Montreal Island. If you ever need a breather or a exploration trip, do come and visit
          the little island. It is quite beautiful and peaceful compared to the energy of the main island of Montreal.</p>
        <p>I live in Montreal with my family: my mom, dad and sister. Before getting into further details about me, I will brief introduce the people who I admire and support in every way they can. </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="slide-right-slower show-on-scroll">My Family</h2>
        <p>My sister, Diana, is currently attending high school and is a devilish angel who loves to be involved and take part of everything I do. Sometimes it could get quite annoying but I do not hate the attention and affection she gives me.</p>
        <p>My dad works as a game dealer at the Casino of Montreal, and is the man of the house. He loves to joke around and just knows how to plan and see things accordingly and realistically. </p>
        <p>As for my mom, she is the incredible Wonder Woman who is always ready to help and makes sure everyone in the family is healthy and happy.</p>
        <p>I am greatful to be surrounded by these family members every single day, through thick and thin, because they made me into who I am today and have supported me in countless ways to help me get to where I am today.</p>

        <h1 class="slide-left show-on-scroll">My Background</h1>
        <p>Originally, I am from Vietnam. I was born and raised in Hô Chi Minh City, previously known as Saigon City. I went to an international elementary school, where I was able to learn English and a few words of French. </p>
        <p>At the age of 8, I moved to Canada and started a new adventure here! I continued the rest of my elementary school years in a French institution and went on to an international high school, where I was able to learn a little bit of Spanish
          and other art forms. </p>

        <img id="picthen" class="slide-up-slower show-on-scroll" src="images\me_at_19.jpg">
        <p>I grew in love with art and wanted to learn more. So I enroll into Dawson College's Visual Arts program, where I was able to learn and grasp a better understanding of the art world.</p>
        <p>I knew what drawing, painting, sculpting,photographing and much more visual arts forms are, before coming into the Visual Arts program. However, it is only until I got a taste of them through practice, experimentations and projects that I
          was able to capture their essence and visualize them in different perspectives.</p>
        <p>Making art was pleasing, meditating and pedagogic but I felt that there was something missing, that this was not what I wanted to do career-wise. So I searched, questioned myself and found an answer: I wanted to not only create but also
          design. Thus, this is where I discovered that Concordia's Design program.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="s2">
      <article class="multi slide-up show-on-scroll">
        <p>To be frank, I was clueless to what the Design program had to offer, but that did not stop me in looking forward to learn something new and to discover a whole new world just like how Visual Arts was new to me after graduating from a very
          academic high school. So I tried my best to submit a portfolio with the artworks that I had produced in Dawson's Visual Arts program and applied to Concordia's Design program.</p>
        <p>Having my fingers crossed, hoping to get in the program despite the limited spots available and surviving the long period of anxiety, I was overjoyed and could not believe that I actually got accepted into the Design program!</p>
        <img id="picthen" class="slide-up-slower show-on-scroll" src="images\me_at_20.jpeg">
        <p>Now here I am, in my second year, learning new things, here and there, about the history of design, graphic design, industrial design, product design, book design, textile design, web design and so much more. Everything is so new and
          refreshing that I cannot get tired of learning more each type of design. Not to mention that I am surrounded by wonderful designer peers and teachers!</p>

        <h1 class="slide-left show-on-scroll">My Interests</h1>
        <p class>I clearly am passionate about art but I also have other interests. Music is a huge part of my life. Wherever I go, music is a must. I cannot survive without music. It is on the same time my escape from reality and the whispers
          bringing me back to reality.</p>
        <p>I am also quite fond of cuisine and gastronomy. I love to cook and eat, especially asian cuisine, though nothing beats my mom's cooking.</p>
        <p>Here are some dishes that my mom and I made. We mainly make Vietnamese dishes but we also love Japanese food, especially sushi. As for desserts, we like to challenge ourselves making different baked goods from time to time for special
          occasions.</p>

        <p>As for Japan, it is the first destination that I will go visit once I get a chance to travel outside of Canada. </p>
        <p><strong>Why? Well, actually, why not?</strong></p>
        <p>Despite not knowing much about the country or the culture due to the fact that Japan was very reserved, I am unconditionally attracted to its culture, lifestyle and entertainment forms. I find Japanese culture exquisite as it maintains the
          traditions that were passed on through several generations so well.</p>
        <p>The local attractions are also very inspiring and enlightening. The people never cease to amaze me with their lifestyles. Their is a mutual respect happening in thin air no matter where you are or who you are.</p>

        <p>Lastly, I am in love with their musical and artistic creations, more specifically manga, anime and J-Pop. I would say that they played an important role in my education and taught me so many life lessons and things that I would have not
          been conscious about or be open-minded about. </p>
        <p>Both forms of entertainment acts indeed as a stress-reliever and a hobby that I am obsessed with but they have also contributed into the making of me. That said, the Japanese culture have influence my ways of thinking greatly.</p>
        <p>Here are some amazing anime (Japanese animation) that I have watched. I recommend watching Studio Ghibli's works and explore more afterwards!</p>

        <p>All this now leads me to tell a little bit about my inspirations to my designs and artworks. There are three keywords that must be displays through my designs and artworks: Aesthetics, Efficiency and Usefulness.</p>
        <p>Anything I do, create or see must be aesthetic to my eyes and mind, if not I utterly have no interest in it. Efficiency is a must in what I use and create, as it should also be applied into my thinking and fabrication process. Usefulness
          is all about the quality or fact of being useful; therefore usability should always be considered in my design and art practices. In essence, these keywords are essential to my daily practices.</p>
